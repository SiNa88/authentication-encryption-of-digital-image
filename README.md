# Introduction

This repository provides the source codes in regard to the research on the performance evaluation of authentication encryption and confidentiality block cipher modes of operation on digital images in the Matlab framework.

## Abstract
Authentication-encryption scheme, such as Offset Code Book (OCB) mode, offers both privacy and authenticity; that is to say, this scheme provides data authenticity without increasing the cost of encryption. The performance of this mode is compared with other confidentiality modes of operation, such as the fast counter (CTR) mode that just encrypts the image without verification. Various statistical methods, such as correlation coefficient, Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) are utilized to analyze the efficiency of different modes. Results show that the model based on OCB scheme, by both AES and Serpent algorithms, exhibits good performance on a digital image compared to the models based on other modes. OCB-AES based scheme, associated with its own authentication, has considerable speed in comparison with other confidentiality modes.
